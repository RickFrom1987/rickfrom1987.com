<b>First job</b>
<p>
My first job ever was at Yahoo! It feels like forever ago. I met great people and lifelong friends here. Yahoo! was one of the best places I have ever worked. Lots of perks and working with really fun and smart people.
</p>

<b>Goals</b>
<p>
My main goal was to learn from others and do the best that I could as I didn't know much about life or programming. I just kind of dove head first into anything they would let me work on.

<p>
Met some great engineers / friends like Naveen, Rohith, Nat and Steven Ramkumar, who have all moved on to do freaking amazing things. I got to work with a great team. Special thanks to everyone on Yahoo! Local who helped me grow as a developer and person, I will never have enough good things to say about my time there.
