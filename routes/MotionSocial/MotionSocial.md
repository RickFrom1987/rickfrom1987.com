I had the opportunity to pair program with one of the co-founders of Picnik/PicMonkey and one of the best developers I have ever worked with. I was brought in to help build a set of internal UI components in React, that could be customized to thier liking. I also had some fun times building out some tests and basic utils to help with image processing and galleries. 

<b>Challenges</b>
<p>We wrestled with the insanity that is webpack/babel and getting my macOS/docker setup to play nicely with his Linux setup. Making sure the custom react components rendered accurately across all browsers desktop/mobile was quite the daunting as well!

<b>Looking Back</b>
<p>
Working with someone who sees solutions so clearly was a wonderful experience for me. I was pushed to write more readable and concise code and always thinking about how to do so, a skill that will carry with me forever! I learned to slow down my thought process and refine, refine, refine.

Working with and getting to know RJ, David and JJHuff was something I will always look back on and have so many great memories, hopefully we'll team up again soon!
