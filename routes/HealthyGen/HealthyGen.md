<b>Technical Challenges</b>
<p>
When HealthyGen reached out to me. Thier technical infrastructure was in poor shape. Everything was alive and ticking, but technology was dated and it was almost impossible to move forward with projects without breaking everyhting or slowing to a halt. The goal was to modernize thier infrastructure, organize thier existing assets/code and push the organization forward all at the same time. Everything ranging from: domains, DNS, websites, web services, source control needed to be updated, documented and changed. There were a lot of unknowns. The approach I took here was to code defensively, remove pieces before adding, migrate services slowly and in small chunks so we could "unit" test different parts of the business as we moved.
