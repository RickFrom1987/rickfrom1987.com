[Haiku Deck](//haikudeck.com) has a very special place in my workplace heart. It was the first ever startup I have worked with and it was awesome. I met some insipiring and amazing people. Learned how much I sucked at programming. Learned how to push through it and get better. I had great programmers around me: Kevin, Adam and Collin. Great leaders: Adam, Marc and Catherine, later on working with the co founder of CoinStar Dan! Great support staff Erin and Lisa MaMa. I worked on the web app and website, mainly in jQuery and Backbone.

My main challenges here were adjusting to startup life, learning quickly and producing results. I always had help of more senior engineers to pick up the pieces, @ Haiku Deck I had to be more self reliant and try to figure stuff out on my own.

We were lucky enough to get some media coverage on my project and work:
