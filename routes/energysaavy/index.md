Brandly is a small startup in Seattle that wants to make ordering business cards easier. They needed some frontend love to bring an existing app up to date. I was brought in to help give the angular app a facelift and make the user experience better. I enjoyed working with Doug, Reed, Saaj and Tony. The team was passionate about what they were doing and it really make a huge difference when you go in everyday.

In this job the first challenge I faced was making small unbreaking chagnings to a complex frontend. The orignal author had since moved on and there was not much documentation or solid patterns to follow. I wanted to show the business progress, by making a ton of changes quickly, but I had to control myself and mensure the app still worked as expected with small controlled changes and testing before moving on.

There was alsoa requirement to build a loading screen in pure js with out any deps, so I did that for them. You can see a standalone version [here](http://brandly-loader.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/).

At the end I was sad to go, but they are on the path forward and I hope to work with the boys again.
