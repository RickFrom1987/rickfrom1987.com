[DataBlade](http://datablade.io) is a small startup trying to make data anlayst lives easier. The platform allows data scientists to access, analyze and automate thier data processing. I was brought onboard to help with the web app and design some of the look and feel of some of thier components. The team was technically very deep and lead by my very talented and good friend Allen, an excellent programmer who has been there for me and encouraged me throught out my painful learning process. I didn't want to let him down.

I was dumped into a complex codebase and needed to produce some results quickly. When I started helping out I was just learning about redux and they had already adopted alt.js. I had to keep pushing on learning the react fluxxy/reduxxy way of doing things, while still making progress using alt.js. It was a challenge because it was like learning how alt.js worked while utilizing the lib in production, kind of crazy, mistakes were made. The experience has helped me going forward and I think about apps in a much cleaner and seperated manner now!
