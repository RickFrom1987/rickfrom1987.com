I love working with Oregon based tech-ed company [Membean](//membean.com). The team at Membean want improve the education system, while improving student's memory and cognitive ability as a whole.

<b>React. React. React.</b>
<p>

Membean is in the process of moving from a old school Rails app to a hybrid Rails/React app. The goal is to build out the next generation/iteration of Membean app in React. We used enzyme for unit testing, which was a pleasure to work with. Redux for state mangement win!

<b>Technical Challenges</b>
<p>

- The spikyness level of the traffic. We provide educational software used mostly during school hours, which means lots of students logging in/out and using our service at the same time. This creates an interesting problem of having heavy usage during certain hours depending on where the school is the world.

- Deploys need to be carefully planned, as there is no need to deploy during heavy usage, or during a busy time of the school year. Very tight time windows and little room for error.

- Optimizing assets and filesize so that students are able to download assets and our js package once. Networks at school at the time of this writing are all over the map. Some with fantastic network speeds, some that are simply unusable.

<b>People</b>
<p>

What can I say. In the tech industry often you find some amount of pretentiousness or "bottom line" guys and gals. Not here. I have never met founders as inpiring. Absolutely amazing team, so kind, friendly and genuine. I have learned so much. Technically and the powerglobal reach andf importance of learning. Work or help them out with anything for the rest of my life if possible.
