The engineers at [EnergySavvy](//energysavvy.com) are awesome and I enjoyed working with them. 

I spent some time working on the main [marketing site](//energysavvy.com), [blog](//blog.energysavvy.com) and some prototypes in React. Here is a standalone version of the [Solar Calculator](https://solar-calculator.rickfrom1987.com) that I wrote. The goal of solar calculator was to help my clients users to calculate thier energy and financial savings when using electric. 

<b>Challenges</b>
<p>
The most difficult part of this project was working with thier math guy and wrapping some unit tests around complex financial and energy calculations. This was quite painful, but we got through it. This was my first real world React project so there was some not so polished code and wtf is this, but it was great learning experience. Working with Kalpana, Gabe and Graham was awesome, all around great company and smart guys and girls!

Hopefully we will cross paths again in the future!
