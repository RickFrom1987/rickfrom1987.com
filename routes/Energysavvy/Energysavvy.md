The engineers at [EnergySavvy](//energysavvy.com) are really good. Thats it for this paragraph.

I spent some time working on some prototypes in React most notably a [Solar Calculator](http://energysavvy.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/react-solar-calculator/dist/index.html). The goal of solar calculator was to help my clients users to calculate thier energy and financial savings when using electric. The most difficult part of this project was working with thier math guys and wrapping some unit tests around complex financial and energy calculations. This was quite painful, but we got through it. This was my first React project so there was some not so polished code and wtf is this, but it was great learning experience and I am much more fluent and comfortable doing things the React way now. Working with Kalpana, Gabe and Graham was awesome, all around great company and smart guys and girls!

Another story of sad to leave, hopefully we will cross paths again in the future!
