My first job ever was at Yahoo! It feels like forever ago. I met great people and lifelong friends here. Yahoo! was one of the best places I have ever worked. Lots of perks and working with really fun and smart people. My main goal was to learn from others and do the best that I could as I didn't know much about life or programming. I just kind of dove head first into anything they would let me work on. Met some great engineers like Naveen, Rohith and Steven Ramkumar. Got to meet Dave Filo and Nate Koeck
