Originally hired by Buuteeq, which became [Booking Suite](http://suite.booking.com). Most of my work here was creating a small eco system of js + css files served up by google app engine. 

<b>Challenges</b>
<p>
I was hired as part of a team, but eventually ended up managing my own project. My goal was to help create a simple and logical way to manage snippets of js and css for thousands of thier client sites. I had to project manage myself, setup my own repos and deploy my code, while working closely with Buuteeq/Booking marketing and product teams.

<b>Growing</b>
<p>
This was one of my first gigs working as a contractor and I have to admit I made some mistakes on the business and coding side of things. I learned a ton about what the right/wrong way to approach problems both with code and with people. A  ton of lessons learned and I grew so much and matured as a person by the end of the journey!

I really enjoyed working with and chatting with Mike, Ed, Nate, Joe, Carlin, Joe, Jacob and Karim <3
