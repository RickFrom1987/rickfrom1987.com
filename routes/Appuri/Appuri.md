The team at [Appuri](//appuri.com) was awesome, so awesome that they are now part of [DocuSign](//docusign.com)!

My time working with Appuri was rewarding and challenging. Feel absolutely humbled and honored to be a part of their story. I would describe my role with the company as a solutions engineer. I was tasked with working closely with different vendors/contractors to deliver solutions to our customers. Dealt with managing a lot of network calls and authentication issues, while connecting to different data sources.

<b>Salesforce Challenges</b>
<p>
I knew nothing about Salesforce going into this role and was presented with some tasks and features that needed to live within the Salesforce ecosystem. If you have ever even opened up the Salesforce dashboard, it is insanity. So many tabs and options. I had to quickly learn the interface, and the semantics of the Salesforce ecosystem (had to ask questiosn and get some help here) while also delivering Appuri features. The importance of isolating and creating a proper test harness was crucial here.

<b>Defensive Coding</b>
<p>
Working with an older and slighlty "under documented" codebase written by engineers who had previously left the company is inherently very difficult. I needed to understand how to add features and make an impact without trashing everything in my wake. My experience with defensive coding came in very handy, starting with removing code and breaking up files in smaller more understandable components was one of the first things I did which allowed me to move forward! I was also able to do some work to clean up and improve our CI with CircleCI to make test run faster and more accurately.

Working at Appuri brought back fantastic memories from the very first startup I worked for. The hustle and drive everyday was great to see and be a part of.
