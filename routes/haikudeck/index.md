Haiku Deck has a very special place in my workplace heart. It was the first ever startup I have worked for and it was awesome. I met some insipiring and amazing people. Learned how much I sucked at programming. Learned how to push through it and get better. I had great programmers around me: Kevin, Adam and Collin. Great leaders: Adam, Marc and Catherine, later on working with the co founder of CoinStar Dan! Great support staff Erin and Lisa MaMa. I worked on the web app and website, mainly in jQuery and Backbone, the good days!

My main challenges here were adjusting to startup life, learning quickly and producing results. I didn't really have to really produce anything tangible in my corporate jobs, I always had help of more senior engineers to pick up the pieces, here I had to be more self reliant or let everyone else down.
