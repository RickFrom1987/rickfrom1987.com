Originally hired by Buuteeq, which became [Booking Suite](suite.booking.com). Most of my work here was creating a small eco system of js + css files served up by google app engine. I was hired as part of a team, but eventually ended up managing my own project. My goal was to help create a simple and logical way to manage snippets of js and css for thousands of thier client sites. I had to project manage myself, setup my own repos and deploy my code, while working closely with Buuteeq/Booking marketing and product teams. I really enjoyed working with and chatting with Mike, Ed, Nate, Joe, Carlin, Joe, Jacob and Karim <3

Looking back on my experience, this was probably my most challenging experience doing contract work in terms of client, RickFrom1987 relations. My code/work was always the best I could do, but working here taught me a really important lesson in dealing with clients. I made many many mistakes, I was just learning my craft and eager to impress and work hard, but probably could have presented myself much better and If I could do it all over again I would have done things much differently. Lesson learned, time to push forward.
