Originally hired by Buuteeq, which was then bought by booking.com. 

THis was probably my most challenging

Looking back I made many mistakes if I could go back and take them back I would. I was jsut learning my craft and eager to impress and work hard, but probably could have presented myself much better and If I could do it all over again I would have done things differently.

I was dumped into a complex codebase and needed to produce some results quickly. When I started helping out I was just learning about redux and they had already adopted alt.js. I had to keep pushing on learning the react fluxxy/reduxxy way of doing things, while still making progress using alt.js. It was a challenge because it was like learning how alt.js worked while utilizing the lib in production, kind of crazy, mistakes were made. The experience has helped me going forward and I think about apps in a much cleaner and seperated manner now!
