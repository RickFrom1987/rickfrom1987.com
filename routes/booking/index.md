Originally hired by Buuteeq, which became [Booking Suite](suite.booking.com). Most of my work here was creating a small eco system of js + css files servedup by google app engine. My goal was to help create a simple and logical way to manage snippets of js and css for thousands of sites. I really enjoyed working with and chatting with Mike, Ed, Nate, Joe and Karim.

Looking back on my experience, this was probably my most challenging experience doing contract work in terms of client, RickFrom1987 relations. My code/work was always the best I could do, but working here taught me a really important lesson in dealing with clients. I made many many mistakes, I was just learning my craft and eager to impress and work hard, but probably could have presented myself much better and If I could do it all over again I would have done things much differently. Lesson learned, time to push forward.
