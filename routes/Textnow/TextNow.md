TextNow reached out to me to help them develop, test and deploy experiments that test user purchasing behavior. I was tasked with implementing features on thier webstore gated behind different flags. Our goal was to see which variant produced the most optimal purchasing behavior. You can checkout the [Textnow webstore here](https://textnow.com/wireless)

<b>Challenges</b>
<p>
A challenge I faced here was simply understanding business requirements as the store is a crucial part of thier business and before touching the codebase, I needed to make sure I understood the checkout workflow and how each product and product options affected that process.

The textnow engineering team is probably one of the best organized based team I have worked with. Communication is clear and concise and reasons behind doing something was purely based on results and most effective code/fix, not just to simply add code and push features blindly. Really enjoy working with Derek, Ajay, Jason and Justin! Canadian rockstars, calling it right now, textnow will be huge.
