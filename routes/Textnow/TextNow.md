TextNow reached out to me to help them develop, test and deploy experiments that test user purchasing behavior. I was tasked with implementing features on thier webstore gated behind different flags for different variations. Our goal was to see which variant produced the most optimal purchasing behavior. You can checkout the [Textnow webstore](https://textnow.com/wireless).

<b>Challenges</b>
<p>
A challenge I faced here was simply understanding business requirements as the store is a crucial part of thier business and before touching the codebase, I needed to make sure I understood the checkout workflow and how each product and product options affected that process.

The textnow engineering team is probably one of the best organized teams I have worked with. Communication is clear and concise and reasons behind doing something was purely based on results and most effective code/fix, not just to simply add code and push features blindly. Really enjoy working with Derek, Ajay, Jason and Justin! Canadian rockstars. Calling it right now, Textnow will be huge!
