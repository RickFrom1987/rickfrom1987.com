[Brandly](//brandly.com) is a small startup in Seattle that wants to make ordering business cards easier. They needed some frontend love to bring an existing angular app up to date. I was brought in to help give the app a facelift and make the user experience better.

<b>Challenges</b>
<p>
In this job the first challenge I faced was making small unbreaking changes to a complex frontend. The original author had since moved on and there was not much documentation or solid patterns to follow.

A big challenge we faced was the legacy frontend went through many iterations we were dealing with jQuery, angular , Django templates, pure js. After a long struggle we settled on rewritting in Vue.js. Which I believe was a good decision, we were able to learn quickly, iterate make changes and deploying the new app relatively quickly and painlessly. Props to Tony!
