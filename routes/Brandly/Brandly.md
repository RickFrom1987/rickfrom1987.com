[Brandly](//brandly.com) is a small startup in Seattle that wants to make ordering business cards easier. They needed some frontend love to bring an existing angular app up to date. I was brought in to help give the app a facelift and make the user experience better. I enjoyed working with Doug, Reed, Saaj and Tony. The team was passionate about what they were doing and it really makes a huge difference when you go in everyday.

<b>Challenges</b>
<p>
In this job the first challenge I faced was making small unbreaking changes to a complex frontend. The original author had since moved on and there was not much documentation or solid patterns to follow. I wanted to show the business progress, by making a ton of changes quickly, but I had to control myself and ensure the app still worked as expected with small controlled changes and testing before moving on.
